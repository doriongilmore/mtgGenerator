### Magic the Gathering - Deck Generator

This app will gather several tools to easily generate Magic decks:

- card search (name - color - capacity - etc.) (thanks to https://github.com/MagicTheGathering/mtg-sdk-javascript)
- deck creation/edition
- import/export from/to text format (several formats supported)
- graphs by decks (mana cost, color repartition, etc.)
- stats - https://github.com/lwardlegit/mtgbuild seems to have nice ones
- ready-to-print - see resizeImage method in Magic.bas file - see also http://pdfkit.org/
